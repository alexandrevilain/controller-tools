# controller-tools

This project provides a set of tools and code libraries to facilitate the development of operators in Go based on controller-runtime.

All packages are originally comming from [temporal-operator](github.com/alexandrevilain/temporal-operator). I found that many packages where generic enough to be moved to a common library.

__Current status:__ Work in progress, I moved everything from the orignal project. Some tests and godoc are missing. Feel free to contribute.
